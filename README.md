Daily Goals
===========
Daily Goals (天天打卡) is an Android task manager application, and it is also my first Android App.   
The App allows you to create some daily goals, such as running or reciting words, and check the process everyday.   
The idea comes from an excellent App called [_ShanBay Words_](http://www.shanbay.com), which is also one of my favorite words-reciting application. I'd like to give my thanks to it.
